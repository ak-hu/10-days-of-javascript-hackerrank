# 10 Days of JavaScript Code Challenge

Welcome to the repository of my "10 Days of JavaScript" code challenge on HackerRank. In this repository, you will find my solutions to JavaScript programming problems from HackerRank.

## About the Challenge

The "10 Days of JavaScript" code challenge consists of JavaScript programming problems. Each day, I solve several problems and share their solution here. I aim to keep the solutions clean, optimized, and well-structured.

## Repository Structure

- Each solution is stored in a separate file named `day-X:problem-name.js`, where `X` represents the day number and `problem-name` is a topic of the problem.
- Each file also contains a detailed explanation of the problem statement and my approach to solving it.
