**Task**

Complete the code in the editor so that it creates a clickable button satisfying the following properties:

- The button's `id` is `btn`.

- The button's initial text label is 0. After each click, the button must increment by 1. Recall that the button's text label is the JS object's `innerHTML` property.

- The button has the following style properties:

    - A `width` of `96px`.

    - A `height` of `48px`.

    - The `font-size` attribute is `24px`.

The `.js` and `.css` files are in different directories, so use the _link_ tag to provide the CSS file path and the _script_ tag to provide the JS file path:

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    
    <body>
    	<script src="js/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>`
